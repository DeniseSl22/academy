              WikiPathways: Assess Recently Changed Pathways
              </span>
            </a>
          </h1>

          <h2>Background</h2>
	  <p>
	  <b>The goal of this task is to assess recent pathway edits and newly added pathways, and to make sure that relevant tags are added and/or updated.</b>
	</p>
          <h2>Instructions</h2>
	  
	  <ul>
	  <li>For the pathway below, <b>click the image or title</b> to view/edit the pathway at WikiPathways. You will need to be logged in at WikiPathways in order to access the editing controls.</li> 
	  <li>Perform the following tasks:</li>
	  <h3>Review edit history</h3>
	  <li>Scroll down to the History section and review the comments for recent changes. Compare to views of prior revisions.</li>
	  <li>If the recent edits are inaccurate or degrade quality, revert the pathway to a revision prior to the latest set of edits.</li>
	  <li>If you reverted an edit (or are uncertain), start a discussion on the pathway and/or with the author directly, explaining your reasoning.</li>
		  <li>If the pathway is new, also perform the following tasks:</li>
		  <li>Assess the technical and stylistic aspects of the content. Consider adding suggested improvements to your welcome message (see below) if you think it 
			  would be helpful to the author.</li>
		  <h4>Fix bad titles</h4>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>Pathway titles should be descriptive. To find a reasonable title, you may need to review the biology described in the pathway or 
    	    		the literature references indicated by the author.</li>
    	  		<li>Pathway titles should be unique. Check the Browse page to see if other pathways with the same title already exist. If so, compare 
    	    		the two pathways and make one or both of the titles more descriptive to highlight the difference.</li>
    	  		<p><i>Note: We encourage having several versions of the same pathway, for example Apoptosis, as long as each pathway describes a useful 
    			variation of the process, or is specialized for a specific tissue or state.</i></p>
		  </ul>
	  
          	<h4>Add ontology tags</h4>
		<ul>
    	  		<li>If the pathway is new, add at least one top-level Pathway Ontology tag. For example, for a metabolic pathway, add the top-level tag 
   			"classic metabolic pathway".</li>
    	  		<li>If possible, also add any other appropriate ontology tags from either of the three categories; Pathway Ontology, Disease and Cell Type.</li>
		 </ul>
		  <h4>Add quality tags</h4>
		  <ul>
    			<li>Tag the pathway as "Under construction" if it was created in the past 30 days and appears incomplete.</li>
    			<li>If the pathway looks like it was created as a test or tutorial, tag as "Test pathway". Many tutorial pathways will be based on the 
    			"circadian clock pathway" used in the Tutorial, or will contain just a few generic datanodes and connections. These will be tagged for 
    			deletion after 30 days. For details on how to add quality tags, see the 
   			 <a href="http://wikipathways.org/index.php/Help:Tutorial:Step_11" target="_blank">Tutorial</a>.</li>
    		</ul>
		  <h4>Contact all new users</h4>
    <ul> 
    <li>If the author is new to WikiPathways (check by clicking on username and "my contributions"), then be sure to start a discussion 
    thread on their new pathway welcoming them and offering help:
    <p>"Thanks for starting a new pathway!  If you need any help with our editing tools, just let us know."</p></li>
    <li>If the pathway looks suspiciously like a test pathway, then tag it as such, but still post a welcome message, perhaps adding:
    <p>"If you are just testing the site, that's okay too. Just delete the pathway when you are done, or let us know and we'll take care of it."</p></li>    
    <p><b>Every new author should have a welcome message on their first pathway attempt.</b></p>
    </ul>
		  <h4>Identify pathways for social media</h4>
    		<ul>
    		<li>Any pathway that looks unique and complete should be highlighted through social media. Suggest that the author share his/her work 
    		via twitter, blogs, emails, etc. via your welcome message. Also contact Kristina Hanspers about tweeting the pathway via @wikipathways.</li>
    		</ul>
		  
	  <h3>Community approval tags</h3>
		<ul>
      		<li>If a changed pathway is tagged with a community approval tag, e.g., "Reactome Approved", collect a summary of pathway page links 
      		and change details to send to each community representative. If you are not already in contact the representative, simply include 
      		the summary of links and details in your wrap-up email to wikipathways-devel and we'll take it from there.</li>
		  </ul>
	  <h3>Add and update quality tags</h3>
		 <ul>
	  	<li>Update faded tags if the recent edits are good by clicking on the <b>click here</b> link provided with "Approved version" and "Featured version" tags.</li>
	  	<li>Consider <b>adding new tags</b>, for example, if the following criteria are met:</li>
		  
	  		<ul>
	  		<li><b>Approved version</b>: Interactions must be complete, most datanodes must be annotated. About 80% coverage of Gene 
	 		 Product datanodes is sufficient, given that some elements might not have mappings. Overall, the pathway should be useful for downstream 
	  		data visualization and analysis.</li>
     			 <li><b>Featured version</b>: In addition to the "Approved version" requirements, the pathway must have a good description and one or more 
      		ontology tags. Non-typical pathways, including gene lists and abstract networks, should be excluded. Overall, a Featured pathway should 
      		have a consistent and informative annotated layout that contributes to the understanding of the biological process.</li>
	  		<li>For both Featured and Approved collections, DO NOT include list-based pathways and other pathways that don't describe a biological process.</li>
	  		</ul>
	  	<li><b>Remove</b> tags that have been addressed and are now outdated. For example the "Add description" tag, "Annotate nodes" tag and "Fix interactions" tag.</li>
	  	<li>Depending on which tags were updated, added or removed for each pathway, click the corresponding "Verify" buttons below. For example,
	  	if a description was added and the "Approved version" tag was added, click the "Verify add description" and "Verify Approved version tag added". 
	  	<i>Note: The above criteria are used mainly for the archive of human and mouse pathways. For species other than human and mouse, these 
	  	criteria are slightly more relaxed. Specifically, pathways don't need to have completed interactions, as long as most datanodes are annotated. 
	  	Even without completed interactions, these pathways are useful for gene set analysis.</i>
		  </ul>
	
	<br />	  
	  <li>Click "Next" to load the next pathway.</li>
