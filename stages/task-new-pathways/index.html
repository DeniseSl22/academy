              WikiPathways: Assess New Pathways
              </span>
            </a>
          </h1>
          <h2>Background</h2>
	  <p>
	  <b>The goal of this task is to ensure that new pathways are reviewed and appropriately named and tagged; also to make sure that 
    new users aren't getting stuck, confused or frustrated.</b>
	</p>
          <h2>Instructions</h2>
	  
	  <ul>
    <li>The focus of this task are all pathways created since the last curation week. Open the 
	  <a href="http://wikipathways.org/index.php/Special:NewPathwaysPage" target="_blank">List of New Pathways</a>.
	    <p><i>Pro-tip: Open all new patwhays at once in a series of new tabs, for easy processing.</i></p>
    <li>For each new pathway, perform the following tasks:</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Contact all new users</h3>
    <ul> 
    <li>If the author is new to WikiPathways (check by clicking on username and "my contributions"), then be sure to start a discussion 
    thread on their new pathway welcoming them and offering help:
    <p>"Thanks for starting a new pathway!  If you need any help with our editing tools, just let us know."</p></li>
    <li>If the pathway looks suspiciously like a test pathway, then tag it as such, but still post a welcome message, perhaps adding:
    <p>"If you are just testing the site, that's okay too. Just delete the pathway when you are done, or let us know and we'll take care of it."</p></li>    
    <p><b>Every new author should have a welcome message on their first pathway attempt.</b></p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Fix bad titles</h3>
    <ul>	 
    <li>Pathway titles should be descriptive. To find a reasonable title, you may need to review the biology described in the pathway or 
    the literature references indicated by the author.</li>
    <li>Pathway titles should be unique. Check the Browse page to see if other pathways with the same title already exist. If so, compare 
    the two pathways and make one or both of the titles more descriptive to highlight the difference.</li>
    <p><i>Note: We encourage having several versions of the same pathway, for example Apoptosis, as long as each pathway describes a useful 
    variation of the process, or is specialized for a specific tissue or state.</i></p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Add quality tags</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Tag the pathway as "Under construction" if it was created in the past 30 days and appears incomplete.</li>
    <li>If the pathway looks like it was created as a test or tutorial, tag as "Test pathway". Many tutorial pathways will be based on the 
    "circadian clock pathway" used in the Tutorial, or will contain just a few generic datanodes and connections. These will be tagged for 
    deletion after 30 days. For details on how to add quality tags, see the 
    <a href="http://wikipathways.org/index.php/Help:Tutorial:Step_11" target="_blank">Tutorial</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Review pathway content</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Assess the technical and stylistic aspects of the content. Add suggestions to your welcome message if you think it would be helpful 
    to the author.If the pathway is public, offer to make the changes yourself to highlight the collaborative nature of our tools.</li>
	  <h3>Add ontology tags</h3>
    <li>For each new pathway, add at least one top-level Pathway Ontology tag. For example, for a metabolic pathway, add the top-level tag 
    "classic metabolic pathway".</li>
    <li>If possible, also add any other appropriate ontology tags from either of the three categories; Pathway Ontology, Disease and Cell Type.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Identify pathways for social media</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Any pathway that looks unique and complete should be highlighted through social media. Suggest that the author share his/her work 
    via twitter, blogs, emails, etc. via your welcome message. Also contact Kristina Hanspers about tweeting the pathway via @wikipathways.</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
